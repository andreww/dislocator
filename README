This package provides a collection of scripts
(mostly written in perl) which can be used to 
perform atomic scale simulations of dislocation
cores at the atomic scale using GULP as the 
main calculation engine. The scripts are
licensed under the GPL. The basic approach 
used is described in:

A. M. Walker, J. D. Gale, B. Slater and 
K. Wright (2005) "Atomic scale modelling of 
the cores of dislocations in complex materials 
part 2: applications", Physical Chemistry 
Chemical Physics, 7 pp.3235-3242. 
doi:10.1039/B505716G

please cite this work in any work based on these
scripts. Some more recent developments have been 
briefly described in:

A. M. Walker (2010) "Simulation of screw dislocations 
in wadsleyite" Physics and Chemistry of Minerals, 37, 
pp.301-310. doi:10.1007/s00269-009-0334-y 

and

scale models of dislocation cores in minerals: progress 
and prospects" Mineralogical Magazine, 74, pp.381-413.

The current status of these tools requiers the user to be 
familar with perl as modifications to the scripts are 
requiered for any new system studied. Contact the author 
<andrew.walker@bristol.ac.uk> for advice. Work to migrate 
these tools to a language more sutible for scientific 
computing is planned. The development of the ideas 
embodied in these tools was supported by NERC and EPSRC.
