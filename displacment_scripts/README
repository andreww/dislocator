The perl scripts:

   *  edge_isotropic_displacments
   *  edge_ortho_displacments
   *  screw_ortho_displacments
   *  general_case_displacments

read a set of elastic constants from a gulp output
file, a Burgers vector, and a set of atomic positions
(in 1D gulp input file format) and write out the atomic
positions modified by the elastic displacment field for 
the relevent type of dislocaton and form of the elastic 
matrix. This is the key setup step needed to set up a 
1D gulp dislocation calculation.

The general case code involves building (and solving) a
sextic polynomial with lots of combinations of elastic
constants contibuting to the coefficents of the polynomial. 
Retyping these terms would be tedious, so they are encoded 
in coeff*.inp. Two scripts are provided to turn these into 
a perl subroutine and a latex equation (coef2perl and 
coef2latex, respectivly).
